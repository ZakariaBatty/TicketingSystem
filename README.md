# TicketingSystem

```
Ticket management system (Incident management) You are asked to analyze and develop a ticket management system, allowing employees to report incidents of their hardware / software.

A ticket (incident) can be either software or hardware, it is written by an employee and mentions:

-Title

-Type

-Dated

-Service or department

-Emergency

-Description

-State

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

An administrator is responsible for assigning incidents to technicians to take charge of them.

A technician takes charge of the ticket and must either close it (after resolving it) or return it to the administrator, who must assign it to another technician.

The system must allow tickets to be displayed:

-by date

-by technician

-by condition

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

The database should include information on:

Service / Department:

-Coded

-Last name

-Responsible

Employee:

-Registration number

-Last name

-First name

-HireDate

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

A statistics section must also be developed.

Good luck.
